# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

The DAG published on [Dagitty](http://dagitty.net/dags.html?id=UDvDOn) aims to identify possible confounders of **Employment status** and **viral load/adherence** relationship.

To facilitate its view, I recommend changing the potion Diagram Style from classic to SEM- like.
```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="20%", fig.height=1, out.width="20%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reco.png")
```

A DAG must be drawn based on knowledge; for that reason, your inputs are relevant to get the correct one.
Important points:
- Arrows imply a relationship between the two variables connected; the flow is unidirectional and temporal.
- The absence of an arrow means no relationship at all. So, in case of doubt, it is better to establish a connection, since this connection does not indicate its directions or signs (e.g. positive o negative relationship, strong or weak one)
- DAG should contain all important variables, even those unmeasured. The unmeasured variables are presented as an elliptic node.
